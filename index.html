          <h2>Arduino Instrument</h2>

            <div class="text">
              <p>For my overarching project I intend to create an instrument with an Arduino. I currently have no electronics experience but I have created web based instruments in the past; combining my passions for music and web development. These projects, <a target="_blank" href="https://alextownson.github.io/soft-sound/">Soft Sound</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://alextownson.github.io/black-box/">Black Box</a>, were the first things I created that I felt genuinely proud of. Black Box in particular inspired this new project as it was the first time I developed something with a physical component. It uses a phone gyroscope as a way to control audio effects. Achieving this proved to be incredibly difficult but the outcome was uniquely mine as opposed to creating my version of an instrument that already existed. This course and project seem like the perfect opportunity to further explore audio programming as it is not something that would otherwise be taught in my graphic design degree. Although I don&#39t know exactly what the final outcome will be, I think this project relates to the course because I will be improving my coding skills, as well as learning a new skill with the Arduino to build an instrument for use in my own music practice. Rather than working with a predefined tool or software, I have the autonomy to create whatever I want or need for my music.</p>

              <p>In order to get this project started I have begun doing research as well as acquiring some tools for my build. The first thing I looked into was getting an Arduino. I ended purchasing an Arduino starter kit with the intention of working my way through the beginner projects included. This way I can familiarize myself with the system and learn the basics I need to make something unique for this project. The next thing I began researching was if I can code my Arduino in JavaScript. This is the only language I know and it is also the language I would like to work in after graduating so it could be a good opportunity to continue practicing. With that being said, since it is the only language I know, perhaps I should try something else. I&#39ll have to decide once I am further along in the project what I have the capacity for. Another resource I acquired is a book called Make: Analog Synthesizers. I am unsure how useful it will be given my choice to use an Arduino but hopefully it will provide some insight into traditional synth builds. I have done some simple searches for other musical instrument Arduino projects but as of right now the biggest unknown is what exactly I will be making. Beyond using an Arduino, possibly JavaScript, and creating something musical, I don&#39t really know. I think I will have a stronger idea of what, after I become more familiar with creating Arduino projects.</p>

              <p>As a project within a project I have decided to learn some more front end developer skills through the creation of this blog. Using Codecademy, I completed an HTML course, a JavaScript course, and a Bootstrap course. The HTML and JavaScript courses felt reassuring to fill in any gaps in my knowledge. The Bootstrap course on the other hand was entirely new, and this is the first time I am implementing this CSS library. I see the benefits to using something like this but since I have designed more using plain CSS, it felt kind of frustrating. I am currently working through the CSS course, and Vue.js course with the intention to implement any new skills here. I will likely add the Sass course to my learning path so that I can better customize Bootstrap.</p>

          <h2>Arduino Starter Kit</h2>
          <div class="text">
            <p>I must admit, I entered this project quite naive. I knew I wanted to learn some basic electronics but when I chose the Arduino, I didn&#39t even <em>really</em> know what a microcontroller was. Having completed the Arduino Starter Kit (see video to the right), I have a much better sense of what I am capable of making as a beginner with the current components I have. I personally found the kit to be incredibly helpful. As I&#39ve mentioned, I had no experience with any of this before embarking on this project. I recognize that tutorials only take learning so far but I&#39m really glad I took this route as it&#39s created a foundation of knowledge for creating future unique projects. I don&#39t think I would have known where to start otherwise.</p>
            
            <p>For my project: I know that I don&#39t want to use the piezo which means I will have to create a controller for a computer based instrument in order to hear sound. I considered the option of using one of the instruments I have already built but I would rather make something intentionally for the Arduino to control. The tilt sensor pales in comparison to using a phone gyroscope so I won&#39t be using this component either. A phototransistor or a temperature sensor could produce some really cool results but I am leaning toward making something more consistent. That leaves pushbuttons and potentiometers as inputs. In terms of outputs, I would like to use LEDs as indicators that <em>something</em> is happening. That leaves my favourite component in the kitâ€¦ the LCD. I don&#39t know why but coding the LCD was so much fun. It also led me to some really great things in my research. It made me think about my GameBoy Color so I started looking into Arduino GameBoy projects:</p>

            <p>I started to look into Trash80 because they sounded familiar and then I found this:</p>

            <p>Not only was the M8 Tracker made with a Teensy but you can make your own DIY version with a Teensy! This is everything I want to make/own and more but this will have to be a continuation of this project outside of the limited time left in our course. I will, however, use the M8 as inspiration for my build. I intend to create a web based step sequencer that is controlled through pushbuttons. The LCD will display a text based menu that functions alongside the web interface, just for fun. Unlike the last sequencer I made, it would be great to have selectable sounds instead of fixed sounds. I will program the sequencer in Javascript and use JohnnyFive to communicate with the Arduino.</p>
