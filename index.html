            <h2 class="mb-2">Arduino Instrument</h2>

            <p>For my overarching project I intend to create an instrument with an Arduino. I currently have no electronics experience but I have created web based instruments in the past; combining my passions for music and web development. These projects, <a target="_blank" href="https://amtownson.github.io/soft-sound/">Soft Sound</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://amtownson.github.io/black-box/">Black Box</a>, were the first things I created that I felt genuinely proud of. Black Box in particular inspired this new project as it was the first time I developed something with a physical component. It uses a phone gyroscope as a way to control audio effects. Achieving this proved to be incredibly difficult but the outcome was uniquely mine as opposed to creating my version of an instrument that already existed. This course and project seem like the perfect opportunity to further explore audio programming as it is not something that would otherwise be taught in my graphic design degree. Although I don&#39t know exactly what the final outcome will be, I think this project relates to the course because I will be improving my coding skills, as well as learning a new skill with the Arduino to build an instrument for use in my own music practice. Rather than working with a predefined tool or software, I have the autonomy to create whatever I want or need for my music.</p>

            <p>In order to get this project started I have begun doing research as well as acquiring some tools for my build. The first thing I looked into was getting an Arduino. I ended purchasing an Arduino starter kit with the intention of working my way through the beginner projects included. This way I can familiarize myself with the system and learn the basics I need to make something unique for this project. The next thing I began researching was if I can code my Arduino in JavaScript. This is the only language I know and it is also the language I would like to work in after graduating so it could be a good opportunity to continue practicing. With that being said, since it is the only language I know, perhaps I should try something else. I&#39ll have to decide once I am further along in the project what I have the capacity for. Another resource I acquired is a book called Make: Analog Synthesizers. I am unsure how useful it will be given my choice to use an Arduino but hopefully it will provide some insight into traditional synth builds. I have done some simple searches for other musical instrument Arduino projects but as of right now the biggest unknown is what exactly I will be making. Beyond using an Arduino, possibly JavaScript, and creating something musical, I don&#39t really know. I think I will have a stronger idea of what, after I become more familiar with creating Arduino projects.</p>

            <p>As a project within a project I have decided to learn some more front end developer skills through the creation of this blog. Using Codecademy, I completed an HTML course, a JavaScript course, and a Bootstrap course. The HTML and JavaScript courses felt reassuring to fill in any gaps in my knowledge. The Bootstrap course on the other hand was entirely new, and this is the first time I am implementing this CSS library. I see the benefits to using something like this but since I have designed more using plain CSS, it felt kind of frustrating. I am currently working through the CSS course, and Vue.js course with the intention to implement any new skills here. I will likely add the Sass course to my learning path so that I can better customize Bootstrap.</p>
